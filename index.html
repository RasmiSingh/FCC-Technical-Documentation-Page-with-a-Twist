  <p>Trade Blocs - also known as Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) - are agreements between groups of countries with regard to trade policies. Trade Blocs aim to reduce or elimiate trade barriers between member countries. This helps increase economic growth and provides a win-win situation for all countries involved in these trade blocs.  </p>  
  <p>
    
    Trade blocs have internal rules that the member countries agree to and external rules regarding their trade with other countries outside of the trade bloc. There are 5 types of trade blocs.
  </p>

  <section id="preferential_trade_area" class=main-section>
      <header>Preferential Trade Area</header>
    <p>
      In a Preferential Trade Area trade bloc there are no external rules. This means that member countries do not have to align their trade policies with countries outside of the Preferential Trade Area.
    </p>
    <p>
      Members of a Preferential Trade Area will lower the barriers to trade among the other member countries. 
    </p>
    </section>
 
    <section id="free_trade_agreement" class="main-section">
      <header>Free Trade Agreement</header>
  <p>
    In a Free Trade Agreement (also known as a Free Trade Area), all trade barriers are removed within the member countries. As with a Preferential Trade Area, Free Trade Agreement are not required to align their trade policies with countries outside the Free Trade Area. 
  </p>
  <p>
      An example of a Free Trade Agreement is NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement). The countries involved are:</p>
  <code>
    <ul>
        <li>Canada;</li>
        <li>the United States of America; and</li>
        <li>
          Mexico.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </code>
  </section>
    
  <section id="customs_union" class="main-section">
      <header>Customs Union</header>
  <p>
    In a Customs Union, member countries elimiate trade barriers among themselves (exactly as a Free Trade Area) as well as set common trade barriers regarding trading with countries outside of the trade bloc. 
  </p>  
  <p>
    An example of a customs union is the Southern African Customs Union (SACU). SACU is made up of the following countries:</p>
  <code>
    <ul>
      <li> Botswana;</li>
      <li>Eswatini (formerly Swaziland);</li>
      <li>Lesotho;</li>
      <li>Namibia; and</li>
      <li>South Africa.</li>
    </ul>
    </code>
  </section>
  
  <section id="common_market" class=main-section>
      <header>Common Market</header>
    <p>Common Markets adopt common external trade barriers and elimiate internal trade barriers. What makes common markets different though is there is free movement of resources among member countries.</p>
    <aside>
      <code>
      Note: the first three trade blocs only dealt with trade of goods and services. Common Markets, and the trade bloc description to follow, include the free movement of resources.
    </code>
    </aside>
    </section>
  
  <section id="economic_union" class="main-section">
      <header>Economic Union</header>
  <p>Economic Unions are trade blocs in which member countries elimiate internal trade barriers, have common external trade barriers, allow free movement of resources and have a uniform set of economic policies.</p>
  <code>
    <p>
    A prime example of an Economic Union is the European Union. 
  </p>

  <p>In conclusion, trade blocs are agreements between countries which then form a trade bloc group. Trade blocs have varying degrees of integration and provide benefits to all members involved.</p>
